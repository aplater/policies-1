# (Preface to Agreement)

## Overview 

Databrary is a data library intended to foster sharing of information among researchers.
Databrary contains De-Identified Data, Non-Identifiable Data, and Metadata.

Databrary also contains Identifiable Data - video/audio recordings and photographic images Databrary calls Recordings - and other sensitive materials, such as Self-Reported Health-Related Information, only some of which are open to the public.

Data in the library might be used to determine the identity of research participants who have been promised confidentiality.

Data might also be used to harm or embarrass Research Participants or other Depicted Individuals.
Accordingly, Databrary requires prior authorization for full access and requires those granted access to uphold the highest ethical standards.

Individuals with authorized access to Databrary are called Investigators.

With appropriate approval (if required) from an Institutional Review Board at an Institution, Investigators may browse, search, and download Data from Databrary for Non-Research purposes; use Databrary for Research purposes; and contribute Data, subject to the Sharing Permissions granted by Research Participants or other individuals depicted in Recordings.

In order to have access, one must register on Databrary and receive approval before viewing or contributing Data.
To qualify for Databrary Principal Investigator status, I must be a Principal Investigator (PI) at my Institution.
If I am a researcher whose work is overseen by someone who is a Databrary Principal Investigator, I may apply to be a Databrary Affiliate Investigator.

If I do not meet either criterion, Databrary may deem me qualified based on my track record of scientific accomplishment or on the basis of a written reference from someone who is an authorized Databrary Principal Investigator and who verifies that my use of Data from the library will be strictly for the purpose of legitimate scientific research.

To apply, I must provide Databrary information about my appointment at my Institution along with contact and other information that verifies my identity.
I must sign and date this agreement, acknowledging my understanding of the terms of this agreement, along with an authorized representative able to enter into this agreement on behalf of myself and my Institution.
If applicable, I must provide the name of the Databrary Principal Investigator who oversees my research or who will write a letter of recommendation on my behalf.
If applicable, I must also provide evidence of my record of scientific accomplishment.

## Sharing Permission Levels

### The sharing permissions levels within Databrary are as follows:

#### Sharing only within a research group

Depicted Individuals may refuse to give permission to share Recordings or Self-Reported Health-Related Information outside a specific research group.
In this case, Databrary may store Data, Recordings, or Self-Reported Health-Related Information but will not permit access by Investigators unless the Data Contributor gives permission.
As Data Contributor, I may choose to permit access to my Data to other Investigators under an existing research protocol approved by a Research Supervision Entity.
Institution, to the extent allowed by law, assumes full responsibility for specifying who is allowed access to my Data, for controlling that access using Databrary's tools, and for any actions others take with my Data.

#### Sharing with all Databrary Investigators, Public Excerpts Prohibited

Alternatively, Depicted Individuals may give permission for their Recordings or Self-Reported Health-Related Information to be shared with other researchers, but not for excerpts to be shown for educational and scientific purposes.
In this case, Recordings or Self-Reported Health-Related Information may be shared with other Databrary Investigators.
Data that are retrieved from Databrary for viewing, downloading, and analysis must be handled according to Databrary's best practices in data security.
No images or parts of Recordings may be shown in public.

#### Sharing with all Databrary Investigators, Public Excerpts Allowed

Finally, in addition to giving permission for their Recordings or Self-Reported Health-Related Information to be shared with other researchers, Depicted Individuals may grant permission to show and distribute Excerpts to the public.
Excerpts selected by an Investigator may be presented in public settings â€” in classrooms, at scientific or technical meetings as long as no Personally Identifying Information about a Depicted Person, with the exception of faces, voices, and location information typically contained in Recordings, is included with the Excerpt.
