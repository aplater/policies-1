#Using the Databrary Release

## How do I prepare to share with Databrary?

Here's what you should do:

- Modify your existing IRB protocol(s) to enable sharing with Databrary. 
	- We recommend using the [Databrary Template Release](release-template.md).
- Double-check your existing protocol for data destruction clauses.
	- You will  want to review your informed consent documents and remove any data destruction clauses as these inherently conflict with the ability to store and share data. Instead, we recommend saying "Data will be stored indefinitely in a secure library on the internet." 
	- NIH and NSF **do not** require data destruction clauses.
- Once you have modified your IRB protocol(s) you may start securing and recording those permissions from participants. 
	- We advise researchers to ask participants for permission to share at the **end** of data collection so that participants have acquired first hand knowledge about the study. This ensures that consent to participate is completely separate from permission to share and eliminates any risk that asking about sharing will affect participation in studies.
- Prepare recordings for sharing with Databrary, including tagging files with the level of permission for each session. Remove personally identifying information from other data and metadata.
- You may also decide to upload data to Databrary *prior* to sharing it with anyone. In this way, Databrary can act like a lab file server. You can decide later whether you want to share data with researchers who are not part of your approved IRB protocol.
- Apply for and be granted Principal Investigator or Affiliate Investigator status with Databrary.

## Adapting the Databrary Release Template 

The language in the [Databrary Release](release-template.md) is only a template and can be adapted to suit the unique needs of each investigator and/or project, as well as the local IRB policies that govern an investigatorâ€™s research. If you need any help using the Databrary Release form for sharing data, or if you have helpful feedback about using the forms, please contact Lisa Steiger at <lisa@databrary.org>. 

#Common Questions about Sharing Video Data

## How can identifiable data that I collect be shared outside of my lab?

Data can only be shared with other Databrary authorized users if (i) the data are [de-identified](definitions.md#de-identified-data), or (ii) the data are video or audio recordings or photographs in which the people depicted have given permission for their data to  be shared. 

Many flat-file data sets can be easily de-identified, but de-identifying recordings is complicated, expensive, and diminishes their value to other researchers. So, to share recordings without removing personal identifiers, Databrary asks researchers to get permission to share from those people who are depicted in recordings. To standardize the process and make it as simple as possible for researchers, we have developed a [Databrary Release Template](release-template.md) that can be added to IRB protocols and used with participants.

The [Databrary Release Template](release-template.md) was developed and refined in close consultation with the IRB office at NYU to give Databrary Investigators a standardized way to obtain the necessary permissions to be shared in Databrary. The template form is designed to make it as clear and unambiguous as possible to participants about what agreeing to share their data in Databrary will mean.

## When should I share data?

Our philosophy about Data Sharing is embodied in our [Data Sharing Manifesto](data-sharing-manifesto.md). We believe sharing data will accelerate the pace of discovery and will lead to stronger, more transperent science.

Unless required by journals or funding agenices, you are never required by Databrary to share data if you do not wish to do so. 

Even if you aren't sure you want to share data now, you may want to be ready to share data in the future. Or, maybe you have archival data you would like to share now, but you aren't sure whether you are able to do so. Here are the steps to take. 

## Can I share data I've already collected?

Some investigators already ask research participants for permission to share [recordings](definitions.md#recordings) with other researchers or to show them for educational or scientific purposes. This permission is often acquired by means of media release language that is sometimes part of the consent process or is separate from the consent to participate in research. 

If you have language that gives you permission to share or show recordings, you may be able to share these with Databrary if your IRB rules that your release language is equivalent to Databrary's or that you require no such release to share. 

Here's what you should do:

- Ask your IRB for permission to share recordings with Databrary under the provisions of your current (IRB-approved) video/audio/photo release form. You will want to provide your IRB copies of your current release form and the [Databrary Template Release](release-template.md). NIH and NSF do not require data destruction clauses.

- Make sure that your informed consent documents **do not** contain data destruction clauses. If they do, you cannot share your recordings with Databrary. Databrary intends to store recordings and other data indefinitely. So, check your consent form and release form language to see whether you have promised to destroy data after a certain date. 

- If you have informed consent documents that contain data destruction clauses, you may still be able to share [de-identified data](definitions.md#de-identified-data) or [metadata](definitions.md#metadata) about your study with Databrary.

- Once you have permission from your IRB to share data, you may contact Databrary for help uploading and sharing your data or you may choose to upload and share the data yourself.
