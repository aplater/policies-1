## Open Access Data Use Terms

Please sign Data Use Terms to access

HCP public data releases include high-resolution MR scans from healthy adults and four imaging modalities: structural images (T1w and T2w), resting-state fMRI (rfMRI), task-fMRI (tfMRI), and high angular resolution diffusion imaging (dMRI). Behavioral data is also largely available, with some restrictions.

The Open Access Dataset includes imaging data and most behavioral data. To protect subject privacy, some of the data (e.g., which subjects are twins) are part of a Restricted Access dataset. Qualified investigators wanting access to the Restricted Access Data must agree in writing to the Restricted Access Data Use Terms. Investigators who prefer to work with datasets that are free of any potential confounding effect of family structure are encouraged to download the existing data packages that are based smaller groups of unrelated subjects.

We are offering data in two possible formats, minimally pre-processed and unprocessed (NIFTI). Because HCP investigators have spent two years developing optimized preprocessing methods and because our preprocessing pipelines have not yet been released, we strongly encourage the use of our minimally preprocessed data.

## Connectome Workbench Data
Group Average Data, HCP Related 120 and Unrelated 40 Groups Updated Sept 23, 2013

This dataset includes group average data from two sets of subjects: an "R120" group of 120 subjects, many of whom are related to one another (twins or non twin siblings) and a "U40" group of 40 unrelated subjects. The anatomical substrate is based on average T1w and T2w volumes and cortical surfaces from the R120 group, plus myelin maps, cortical thickness maps, and task-fMRI results (7 tasks and many task contrasts) for both the R120 and U40 groups.

The associated scene file enables interactive access to group average (R120 and U40) functional connectivity (fcMRI) data (33 GB "dense connectomes") that are stored on ConnectomeDB. The download package includes a short tutorial for easy viewing in Connectome Workbench (Beta v0.83 and later). The tutorial also includes instructions on how to download the "group-PCA eigenmaps", which are a more compact representation than the fcMRI dense connectomes and can be used to quickly and faithfully generate local copies of the dense connectomes.

## Connectome Workbench Tutorial Data Updated Aug 21, 2013

This dataset to be used with the Workbench Beta v0.83 Tutorial & User Guide (August 2013), contains Q1 individual and group average cortical surface and volume data (T1/T2 volumes, myelin maps, task fMRI contrasts), including the Q1 Group Average Data, version 1b.

### WU-Minn HCP TFM Release 1 Released Oct 11, 2012

The "HCP TFM" dataset includes seven low-TR resting-state fMRI scans from five subjects and is the same dataset used in a study of Temporal Functional Modes (TFMs) by Smith et al. (2012).

Terms of Use: HCP Phase II Open Access Data.
WU-Minn HCP Consortium Open Access Data Use Terms

I request access to data collected by the Washington University - University of Minnesota Consortium of the Human Connectome Project (WU-Minn HCP), and I agree to the following:

I will not attempt to establish the identity of or attempt to contact any of the included human subjects.
I understand that under no circumstances will the code that would link these data to Protected Health Information be given to me, nor will any additional information about individual human subjects be released to me under these Open Access Data Use Terms.
I will comply with all relevant rules and regulations imposed by my institution. This may mean that I need my research to be approved or declared exempt by a committee that oversees research on human subjects, e.g. my IRB or Ethics Committee. The released HCP data are not considered de-identified, insofar as certain combinations of HCP Restricted Data (available through a separate process) might allow identification of individuals. Different committees operate under different national, state and local laws and may interpret regulations differently, so it is important to ask about this. If needed and upon request, the HCP will provide a certificate stating that you have accepted the HCP Open Access Data Use Terms.
I may redistribute original WU-Minn HCP Open Access data and any derived data as long as the data are redistributed under these same Data Use Terms.
I will acknowledge the use of WU-Minn HCP data and data derived from WU-Minn HCP data when publicly presenting any results or algorithms that benefitted from their use.
Papers, book chapters, books, posters, oral presentations, and all other printed and digital presentations of results derived from HCP data should contain the following wording in the acknowledgments section: "Data were provided [in part] by the Human Connectome Project, WU-Minn Consortium (Principal Investigators: David Van Essen and Kamil Ugurbil; 1U54MH091657) funded by the 16 NIH Institutes and Centers that support the NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research; and by the McDonnell Center for Systems Neuroscience at Washington University."
Authors of publications or presentations using WU-Minn HCP data should cite relevant publications describing the methods used by the HCP to acquire and process the data. The specific publications that are appropriate to cite in any given study will depend on what HCP data were used and for what purposes. An annotated and appropriately up-to-date list of publications that may warrant consideration is available at http://www.humanconnectome.org/about/acknowledgehcp.html
The WU-Minn HCP Consortium as a whole should not be included as an author of publications or presentations if this authorship would be based solely on the use of WU-Minn HCP data.
Failure to abide by these guidelines will result in termination of my privileges to access WU-Minn HCP data.
