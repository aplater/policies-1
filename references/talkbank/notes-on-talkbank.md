## [Rules](http://www.talkbank.org/share/rules.html)

Read and follow [Code of Ethics](http://www.talkbank.org/share/ethics.html). This largely refers to the APA, AAAS, and ASA Codes.

Join TalkBank by applying to Brian MacWhinney.

## [Principles](http://www.talkbank.org/share/principles.html)

Notes reasons **not** to share: 

- Don't have IRB permission
- Pretenure

## [IRB Approval](http://www.talkbank.org/share/irb)

Nine! [levels of access](http://www.talkbank.org/share/irb/options.html) offered:

1. No restrictions placed. This level allows access over the web to both transcripts and media without pseudonymization.
2. Pseudonymization of last names and addresses. Participant's last names and information regarding addresses or locations will be replaced by pseudonyms in the transcripts. This preserves the bulk of the interaction and requires only a bit of work to replace a few words.
3. Fuller pseudonymization. In addition to basic pseudonymization, we can also pseudonymize first names. Because first names cannot uniquely identify an individual, this is usually not important in terms of maintaining privacy. However, it may be required in some cases.
4. Audio bleeping. In addition to pseudonymization, participants can request either partial or full audio bleeping of pseudonyms. **Currently, only two TalkBank datasets use audio bleeping (Deuchar and SBCSAE)**
5. Video blurring. In some cases, video blurring may be requested. Blurring is technically quite difficult to implement and highly disruptive of the data. Therefore, it is usually better to protect sensitive video data using other methods such as passwords, described below. **Currently, there are no TalkBank datasets that use video blurring.**
6. Password protection. Access to data may be restricted to certain individuals or groups of individuals. It is relatively easy to implement password protection. However, protection of this sort tends to limit easy access and availability. **Currently, only the Aphasia data in TalkBank are password protected.**
7. Non-disclosure form. For cases requiring extreme protection, password protection can be accompanied by signing of a non-disclosure form. This form prohibits the publication of any reference that identifies individuals. No copying of the data is allowed. **No TalkBank data are subject to this restriction.**
8. Controlled viewing. This level of access requires that data can only be viewed in controlled conditions under direct on-line supervision. This level is needed for data of a highly personal or revealing nature. This level has been used in the past for the viewing of material from psychiatric interviews.
	- Sounds like ICSPR's MET project 	
9. Archiving only: These data would not be viewable over the web, but would be archived in the format of the general system for offline use. This level allows the investigator to use the tools of the analysis system without actually adding the data to the online database.

## Key points

1. No permission to share sought separately. Integrated with permission to participate in research.
2. Data sharing mechanism -- [AphasiaBank](talkbank-consent-cmu.md/#AphasiaBank) -- defined generically.
3. Participants agree that ["dataâ€¦may be published and/or disclosed by Carnegie Mellon to others outside of Carnegie Mellon"](talkbank-consent-cmu.md/#Disclosure)
4. No specific researcher agreement.
5. Do seek separate optional permissions for the use of what Databrary would call [Excerpts](definitions.md/#Excerpts) for scientific or educational purposes.
