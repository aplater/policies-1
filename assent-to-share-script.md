## Assent to Share HEALTH(Self-Reported Health-Related Information,Recordings) Script for Children

### Spoken to child by Experimenter:

*Earlier, we asked you if you wanted to be in the study and if we could HEALTH(ask questions about your health,tape you while you [describe task]). You said yes.*

*Right now, only the people who work in this room will HEALTH(know what you said about your health,see your tapes). We want to ask whether you say it is okay for us to HEALTH(let,put these tapes in a library so that) other scientists who don't work in this room HEALTH(know about what you told us,can also see them). There are many other scientists who want to learn about how children grow and HEALTH(change and stay healthy,change), but they can't because they don't work in this room.*

*If you say yes, only other scientists who have approval to use the library will HEALTH(know what you said about your health,see the tapes). Your friends, your teachers, and your classmates won't HEALTH(,be able to see them) unless you say it is okay.* 

*Please talk this over with your parents before you decide if you want HEALTH(information about your health,your tapes) to be in the library. I will also ask your parents to give their permission for your HEALTH(information,tapes) to be in the library, but even if your parents say "yes" you can still say "no" and decide not to put your HEALTH(information,tapes) in the library.*

*If you don't want HEALTH(information about your health,your tapes) to be in the library, we don't have to put HEALTH(it,them) in there. Remember, having your HEALTH(information,tapes) in the library is up to you. No one will be upset if you don't want HEALTH(it,the tapes) to be in there.*

*You can ask any questions that you have about the library. If you have a question later that you didn't think of now, you can call me or ask [your parents, teacher, whoever the child may choose] to call me at [telephone number].*

*Would you like to have HEALTH(information about your health,your tapes) stored in the library?*
