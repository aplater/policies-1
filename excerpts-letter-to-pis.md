Dear Databrary User,

We're writing to clarify Databrary's language about where and when excerpts can be shown so that all parties concerned--participants, parents, researchers who share excerpts, and researchers who want to show others' excerpts—-have the same understanding. [INCLUDE AS APPROPRIATE Because you are a Databrary user who has shared excerpts with identifiable information, we wanted to bring this clarification to your attention.]

As a reminder, Databrary has four increasingly open levels of sharing (https://databrary.org/access/guide/investigators/release/release-levels.html):
1. Unreleased or private [https://nyu.databrary.org/web/icons/release/unknown.svg and https://nyu.databrary.org/web/icons/release/private.svg]
2. Shared only with authorized investigators [https://nyu.databrary.org/web/icons/release/shared.svg]
3. Shared with authorized investigators plus allows excerpts to be created and shown for informational/research purposes [https://nyu.databrary.org/web/icons/release/excerpts.svg]
4. Shared with the public [https://nyu.databrary.org/web/icons/release/public.svg]

Many of the settings (e.g., classroom lectures, colloquia, conference presentations) where excerpts (Level 3; leaf-plus icon) are typically shown are essentially public because the presenter has little control over who is in the room. People in the audience at such presentations often record portions of lectures or talks containing excerpts. Recordings of lectures and talks are sometimes posted in public forums such as YouTube. Such practices are common and are becoming increasingly frequent. They have likely occurred already during your lectures and research presentations.

We have altering Databrary’s release template, user guide, and website language to make it clear that excerpts covered under the Excerpts (leaf-plus) sharing release level are allowed to be shown by authorized Databrary users in such public settings for informational or research purposes. We've also made it clear that recordings of presentations might be posted in public settings such as YouTube. A summary of the language changes may be found here: <https://databrary.org/access/policies/excerpts.html>

We view these changes as a clarification of the existing policy. We have always encouraged authorized Databrary users to share and show excerpts when participants have given permission to do so. That use case is central to Databrary's mission.

If you have any questions about how this clarification affects any data you have shared with or downloaded from Databrary, please let us know.

Best,

Databrary Team
