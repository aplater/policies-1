Many institutions require that **all** activities involving human subjects must be reported to an IRB, but an IRB may determine that some activities are not regulated under the "Common Rule." In other words, an *Investigator* seeking access to Databrary may need to check with their IRB to determine what IRB review, if any, is required. Here are some example scenarios.

**An *Investigator* wants to use excerpts from videos in Databrary for a class.**

Under Databrary's policies, *Investigators* may only show excerpts in public settings from recordings that have been permissioned for that purpose. This activity is not research. The *Investigator's* IRB may determine that the activity is not regulated. 

**An *Investigator* wants to use excerpts from videos in Databrary for demonstrate a research method or finding in a scientific talk.**

Under Databrary's policies, *Investigators* may only show in public settings excerpts from recordings that have been permissioned for that purpose. The activity is not research&mdash;no new generalizable knowledge is generated. The *Investigator's* IRB may determine that the activity is not regulated. 

**An *Investigator* wants to find videos on Databrary and do preliminary analyses on them to assess the feasibility of future research.**

If the results of the analyses will not be used in a presentation or publication, the activity is not research as no new generalizable knowledge is generated. The *Investigator's* IRB may determine that the activity is not regulated. *Investigators* may view or show in a laboratory setting any recordings that have been permissioned for sharing. 

Under Databrary policies, the *Investigator* will only have access to recordings from participants who have given explicit permission for sharing. Data providers must eliminate personally identifying information from other data they share. So, the risk of re-identification under re-analysis is low, significantly lower than that associated with the original data collection by the data provider who collected and shared the data. Moreover, *Investigators* promise to maintain participant confidentiality even if the identities of research participants are inadvertently discovered.

**An *Investigator* wants to conduct a re-analysis of videos on Databrary.**

The activity is research and requires IRB review, but it may not constitute research with human subjects. The *Investigator* will not have contact with research participants, and no information about the identity of research participants&mdash;beyond images or sounds on the videos&mdash;is available to the *Investigator*.
