### Overview

This form requests my permission to include [ video/audio recordings or still images of | self-reported health-related information about ] [ your child | you | you ] in a secure data library on the Internet (Databrary.org). The library allows authorized researchers to share data. Data sharing will help researchers to learn more and will lead to faster progress in our understanding of human development.

Giving permission to share is entirely separate from giving consent to participate in a research study. I do not have to give permission to share [ my child’s | my | my ] [ video/audio recordings or still images | self-reported health-related information ] in the library.

[ My child’s | My | My ] image and/or voice may be seen or heard on the video/audio recordings or still images. [ My child’s name and/or my | My | My ] name may be spoken aloud.

Someone might be able to identify [ my child,| me or my family ] or other people unintentionally. But, the authorized researchers with access to the library promise to keep private the identities of all people in the video/audio recordings or still images.

### Who can access information in the library?

Only authorized researchers have access to information in the library. Researchers who are granted access must sign a contract that requires them to maintain confidentiality and not to use information for commercial purposes.

### How long will information remain in the library?

Information in the library will be preserved forever in a secure location. Databrary does not intend to erase the information. Databrary intends to store the information so that future researchers may be able to use it.

If in the future I no longer wish to have [ my child’s | my | my ] [ video/audio recordings or still images | self-reported health-related information ] stored in the library, I will contact Databrary at ethics@databrary.org.
