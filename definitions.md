### People

#### Principal Investigator (PI), Principal Investigator (PI) Status

An employee of an *Institution* who has the background and training in scientific and administrative oversight necessary to conduct and manage a sponsored project. 
*Institutions* determine who may have PI status, but the definition typically includes tenure-track faculty (Instructor through Professor, sometimes Emeritus), research 
or clinical faculty faculty, and may include archivists, curators, and librarians. Research Associates, Research Assistants, and other staff are not considered to be 
independent investigators, and therefore are not typically granted PI status.

An individual with *Principal Investigator (PI)* status at an *Institution* who has received authorization from Databrary to view, download, and contribute *Data*.

#### Depicted Individual(s)

#### Non-Identifiable Data

Collections of information that do not contain *Identifiable Data*.

#### De-identified Data

Collections of information from which *PII* has been removed or altered in such a way as to prevent the identification of individual persons.

#### Recordings

Video or audio recordings or still (photographic) images.

#### Personally Identifying Information (PII)

See also: [HIPAA indentifiers](http://privacyruleandresearch.nih.gov/pr_08.asp)

- Full name
- National identification number (e.g., Social Security number)
- Internet Protocol (IP) address
- Vehicle registration plate number
- Driver's license number
- Health certificate or insurance number
- Fingerprints, or handwriting
- Credit card or financial account or access numbers
- Digital identity (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, email account names)
- Date of birth
- Birthplace
- Address
- Telephone number
- Faces and voices.

#### Shareable Identifiable Data

*Identifiable Data* for which a *Depicted Individual* has granted *Assent to Share Data* or *Permission to Share Data*. 

#### Metadata

Information that describes how, where, why, and by whom *Identifiable Data*, *De-Identified Data* or *Non-Identifiable Data* were collected.

#### Self-Reported Health-Related Information

Information about an individual or *Minor* child's health status that is reported by the individual or an individual's parent or legal guardian, not by a health-care provider.

#### Data

### Contributed Data

Any *Data* that a *Data Contributor* has contributed to Databrary and permitted Databrary to share with others.

#### Excerpts

An excerpt is a still frame or a selection from a larger *Recording* that illustrates a particular point or demonstrates a finding. It is typically no more than a few seconds or minutes in length, substantially less than the full length of a *Recording*. *Investigators* or *Affiliate Investigators* may select segments of a recording as an *Excerpt* for display in public settings if the *Depicted Individuals* have granted appropriate sharing permission. 

#### Digital Files

Video or audio recordings or photographs stored in an electronic form that may be readily shared (copied or sent) to other people who are not *Research Staff* over electronic networks like the Internet.

#### Best Practices in Data Security

Measures taken to shield digital information from unauthorized access and to preserve it for future authorized use. See Databrary [best practices](http://github.com/databrary/polices/best-practices.md) for examples.

### Actions

#### Permission/Consent, Sharing Permission/Consent (Level)

Specific rights for sharing and public release granted by *Depicted Individuals* in a *Permission to Share Data* document.

Databrary currently supports four (4) levels of *Sharing Permission*:

1. **No-sharing (Private)**
	- Databrary may store *Recordings* or *Self-Reported Health-Related Information* but not share them beyond the set of *Investigators* who are part of the *Data Contributor*’s approved research team under an existing research protocol approved by a *Research Supervision Entity*. The full responsibility for identifying who constitutes the set of researchers allowed access in this case is the *Data Contributor’s*.

2. **Sharing with Databrary *Investigators* and *Affiliate Investigators* (Shared)**
	- *Data* may be shared with other Databrary *Investigators* or *Affiliate Investigators*, but no *Recordings* or *Excerpts* may be shown in public.

3. **Sharing and Public Excerpts Permitted (Excerptable)**
	- *Data* may be shared with other Databrary *Investigators* or *Affiliate Investigators*. *Excerpts* may be selected by an *Investigator* and may be presented in public settings -— in classrooms, at scientific or technical meetings —- and may be published in the media, in textbooks, scientific publications, or on the Internet as long as no *Personally Identifying Information* about a *Depicted Person* is included with the *Excerpt*.

4. **Public**
	- *Data*, including recordings, may be shared openly with the *Public*.

#### Access Permissions (Level)

Specific permissions placed on a study or other digital object by a Researcher controlling its access by other Databrary users.
These are distinct from and may have more flexibility than Sharing Permission.

#### Authorization, User/Investigator Authorization (Level)

Privileges granted to individuals to access Databrary.

#### Promise of Confidentiality

A promise to a respondent or *Research Participant* that the information the respondent provides will not be disseminated without the permission of the respondent; that the fact that the respondent participated in the study will not be disclosed; and that disseminated information will include no linkages to the identity of the respondent. Such a promise encompasses traditional notions of both confidentiality and anonymity. Names and other identifying information regarding respondents, proxies, or other persons on whom the respondent or proxy provides information, are presumed to be confidential.

#### Deductive Disclosure

The discerning of an individual's identity or confidential information through the use of known characteristics of that individual. Disclosure risk is present if an unacceptably narrow estimation of an individual’s confidential information is possible or if determining the exact attributes of the individual is possible with a high level of confidence.

#### Public Showing

Playing an audio or video segment or showing a photograph to an audience that is not limited to *Research Staff*.

#### Research

A systematic investigation, including research development, testing and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge. [45 CFR 46.102(d)](http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.html#46.102)

#### Non-Research, Non-Research Activities, Non-Research Scientific Activities

Work by *Investigators* or *Affiliate Investigators* involving *Data* that falls outside the scope of *Research*, but respects research ethics principles.
