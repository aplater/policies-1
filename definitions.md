## Authorized investigator
An individual who has permission from an institution to conduct independent research, who has received authorization through their institution and from Databrary to view, download, and contribute Data.

An employee of an institution who has the background and training in scientific and administrative oversight necessary to conduct and manage research.

Research Associates, Research Assistants, and other staff are not considered to be independent investigators, and therefore are not typically granted permission to conduct independent research.
