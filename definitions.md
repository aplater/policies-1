### Actions

#### Promise of Confidentiality

A promise to a respondent or *Research Participant* that the information the respondent provides will not be disseminated without the permission of the respondent; that the fact that the respondent participated in the study will not be disclosed; and that disseminated information will include no linkages to the identity of the respondent. Such a promise encompasses traditional notions of both confidentiality and anonymity. Names and other identifying information regarding respondents, proxies, or other persons on whom the respondent or proxy provides information, are presumed to be confidential.

#### Deductive Disclosure

The discerning of an individual's identity or confidential information through the use of known characteristics of that individual. Disclosure risk is present if an unacceptably narrow estimation of an individual’s confidential information is possible or if determining the exact attributes of the individual is possible with a high level of confidence.

#### Public Showing

Playing an audio or video segment or showing a photograph to an audience that is not limited to *Research Staff*.
