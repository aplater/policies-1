# Web Developer

Institute of Human Development and Social Change, NYU

### Summary

The Databrary project seeks a motivated and flexible developer to help build a web-based data library.
You will work with users and other developers to design and build the front end UI and tools to enable behavioral researchers to collaborate, store, explore, and access research datasets.

Databrary (databrary.org) is a web-based data library where scientists who collect and analyze video will store and share their data openly with other researchers.
Databrary's leaders, based at New York University and Penn State, have been funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to create the Databrary data library, improve an existing free, cross-platform video coding and analysis tool (datavyu.org), and build a desktop lab/data management tool to make data sharing easy and convenient.
The goal is to accelerate the pace of discovery in psychology and developmental science and improve scientific transparency and accountability.

### Responsibilities

- Implement dynamic and modular web application to present and manipulate research materials.
- Create, test, and validate interface (UX and UI) designs using rapid visual prototyping techniques.
- Directly work with researchers (users) to identify and prioritize new features.
- Learn, understand, and reorganize research data as needed for better integration with the site.

### Qualifications

- Bachelor's in CS or other relevant field and 3+ years programming experience
- Knowledge of modern MVC web development frameworks (Django, Rails, Lift, etc.)
- Experience with Ajax and working knowledge of HTML5 and CSS3
