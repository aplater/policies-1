# Web UI/UX Designer (Front-end Developer)

Institute of Human Development and Social Change, NYU

### Summary

The Databrary project seeks a UI/UX designer with strong HTML5 and CSS3 skills who will be able to design and create interfaces that foster a new culture of collaboration between behavioral researchers.
You will work closely with software developers to shape the experiences that behavioral researchers will have with a new breed of data sharing tools.
Your designs will provide the front end to a new package of sharing software that will enable the storage, access, exploration and analysis of very large research datasets.

Databrary (Databrary.org) is a web-based data library where scientists who collect and analyze video will store and share their data openly with other researchers.
Databrary's leaders, based at New York University and Penn State, have been funded by the U.S.  National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to create the Databrary data library, improve an existing free, cross-platform video coding and analysis tool (OpenSHAPA.org/Datavyu.org), and build a desktop lab/data management tool to make data sharing easy and convenient.
The goal is to accelerate the pace of discovery in psychology and developmental science and improve scientific transparency and accountability.
