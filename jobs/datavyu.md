# Video Data Visualization Web Developer

Databrary

Institute of Human Development and Social Change, NYU

### Summary

The Databrary project seeks a motivated and flexible developer to transition an existing open source video analysis application (datavyu.org) to a new web-based platform (databrary.org).
You will take ownership of the research tool, working to support researchers and other users, while designing and reimplementing its functionality with modern web technology.

Databrary (databrary.org) is a web-based data library where scientists who collect and analyze video will store and share their data openly with other researchers.
Databrary's leaders, based at New York University and Penn State, have been funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to create the Databrary data library, improve an existing free, cross-platform video coding and analysis tool (datavyu.org), and build a lab/data management tool to make data sharing easy and convenient.
The goal is to accelerate the pace of discovery in psychology and developmental science through open source and to improve scientific transparency and accountability.

### Responsibilities

- Learn, maintain, and help phase out an existing Java desktop analysis tool.
- Interact with user to understand its current research uses and limitations.
- Design a new web-based implementation using modern technologies.
- Work with a small team to implement front-end interface, API, and back-end data storage.
- Build future enhancements including data visualization, import and export, and integration with data sharing.

### Qualifications
