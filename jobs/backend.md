# Research Data Library Back-end Developer

Databrary

Institute of Human Development and Social Change, NYU

### Summary

The Databrary project seeks a motivated programmer to help build an open source web-based data library.
You will work with other developers and data curators to develop back-end interfaces and tools to enable behavioral researchers to search, collaborate, store, explore, and present research datasets.

Databrary (databrary.org) is a web-based data library where scientists who collect and analyze video will store and share their data openly with other researchers.
Databrary's leaders, based at New York University and Penn State, have been funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to create the Databrary data library, improve an existing free, cross-platform video coding and analysis tool (datavyu.org), and build a lab/data management tool to make data sharing easy and convenient.
The goal is to accelerate the pace of discovery in psychology and developmental science through open source and to improve scientific transparency and accountability.

### Responsibilities

- Work with a small team to implement web APIs and data management tools.
- Design, implement, test, and validate data management and web framework controllers in Scala.
- Learn, understand, and reorganize research data as needed for better integration with the site.
- Implement dynamic and modular web application to organize, present, and manipulate research materials.

### Qualifications

- Background in CS or other relevant field and functional programming experience in OCaml, Haskell, Scala, or Clojure
- Knowledge of modern relational database, video, and web technologies such as PostgreSQL, ffmpeg, and play
- Understanding of security and ethical concerns around sensitive data
- Familiarity with standard UNIX development tools such as git

#### Preferred

- 2-5 years of software development experience
- History of contributions to open source projects
- Experience creating data processing pipelines and RESTful interfaces for structured data
- Basic understanding of scientific practices and research tools, such as Matlab, SPSS, or R
