### Summary

The Databrary project seeks a creative and productive web developer to build the web-based front-end for an open data library.

Databrary's leaders, based at New York University and Penn State, have been funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to create the Databrary data library, improve an existing free, cross-platform video coding and analysis tool (OpenSHAPA.org/Datavyu.org), and build a desktop lab/data management tool to make data sharing easy and convenient.
