# Java QA Engineer

Institute of Human Development and Social Change, NYU

### Summary

The Databrary project seeks a creative and flexible quality assurance engineer to test and enhance an open source multi-platform video data analysis application (datavyu.org).
You would provide an interface between developers and academic users, with many opportunities to employ and expand your Java and Ruby programming skills.

Databrary (databrary.org) is a web-based data library where scientists who collect and analyze video will store and share their data openly with other researchers.
Databrary's leaders, based at New York University and Penn State, have been funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to create the Databrary data library, improve an existing free, cross-platform video coding and analysis tool (datavyu.org), and build a desktop lab/data management tool to make data sharing easy and convenient.
The goal is to accelerate the pace of discovery in psychology and developmental science and improve scientific transparency and accountability.

### Responsibilities

- Learn the use and structure of a Java scientific video analysis tool and Ruby-based scripting language.
- Perform research analysis tasks to identify and diagnose problems with the tool.
- Work with users to understand existing work flows, provide support and training, and capture issues and feature requests in bug reports.
- Provide minor Java fixes and enhancements, and work with other developers to explain and implement larger projects.

### Qualifications

- Excellent written and verbal technical and non-technical communication skills
- Prior programming experience with Java
- Understanding of software development process, bug tracking, and source code management
- Experience working with cross-platform applications under Windows, OS X, and Linux

#### Preferred

- History of active contributions to open source projects
- Familiarity with standard UNIX development tools such as git
- Experience with video playback/transcoding tools such as FFmpeg, VLC, and gstreamer
- Previous QA and software testing experience
