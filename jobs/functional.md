# Open Source Functional Programmer

Institute of Human Development and Social Change, NYU

### Summary

The Databrary project seeks a motivated and flexible functional programmer to help create an open source web-based video library from scratch.
You will work with users, librarians, and a small team of developers to design and build tools to enable behavioral researchers to collaborate, store, explore, and access research datasets.

Databrary (databrary.org) is a web-based data library where scientists who collect and analyze video will store and share their data openly with other researchers.
Databrary's leaders, based at New York University and Penn State, have been funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to create the Databrary data library, improve an existing free, cross-platform video coding and analysis tool (datavyu.org), and build a desktop lab/data management tool to make data sharing easy and convenient.
The goal is to accelerate the pace of discovery in psychology and developmental science and improve scientific transparency and accountability.

### Responsibilities

- Build dynamic and modular web application to organize, present, and manipulate research materials.
- Design, implement, test, and validate data management and web-based tools in Scala and/or Haskell.
- Directly work with researchers (users) to identify and prioritize new features.
- Learn, understand, and reorganize research data as needed for better integration with the site.

### Qualifications

- Background in CS or other relevant field and functional programming experience (OCaml, Haskell, Scala, etc.)
- Knowledge of modern web, SQL, and NoSQL technologies
- Familiarity with standard UNIX development tools such as git
- Understanding of security and ethical concerns around sensitive data

#### Preferred

- History of contributions to open source projects
- Familiarity with Play, Snap, or other web framework
- Experience creating RESTful interfaces for structured data
- Basic understanding of scientific practices and research tools, such as Matlab, SPSS, or R
- Comfortable with Agile software development methodologies
