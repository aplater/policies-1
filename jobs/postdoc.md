# Postdoctoral Fellow

Institute of Human Development and Social Change, NYU

### Summary

The Databrary project, in coordination with the Department of Psychology and Digital Library Services at NYU, seeks a cross-disciplinary postdoctoral fellow looking to expand their knowledge of research methods and technology practices in science and industry.
You will participate in design, development, and deployment of technology to support collaboration, exploration, and analysis of open research datasets.

Databrary (databrary.org) is a web-based data library where scientists who collect and analyze video will store and share their data openly with other researchers.
Databrary's leaders, based at New York University and Penn State, have been funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to create the Databrary data library, improve an existing free, cross-platform video coding and analysis tool (datavyu.org), and build a desktop lab/data management tool to make data sharing easy and convenient.
The goal is to accelerate the pace of discovery in psychology and developmental science and improve scientific transparency and accountability.

### Responsibilities

- Design new approaches for structuring, presenting, and sharing research data.
- Work with a small team of software developers to build web, mobile, and desktop software tools to manage, analyze, and visualize data.
- Engage with researchers within and beyond the fields of developmental psychology, library science, and computer vision to collect, organize, and repurpose data.

### Qualifications

- Strong programming skills in at least two languages (such as Matlab, R, Python, Ruby, JavaScript)
- Experience working with and analyzing videos, physiological data, imaging data, or other large datasets
- Familiarity with standard development and collaboration tools such as git
- Willingness to learn and work with the latest web-based technologies

#### Preferred

- Understanding of web technologies including HTML, JavaScript, and MVC frameworks
- Knowledge of SQL or other database technologies
- History of collaboration and cooperation on previous projects
