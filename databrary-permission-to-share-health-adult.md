Researchers who are granted access must sign a contract that requires them to maintain confidentiality (keep information private) and not to use information for commercial purposes. Researchers promise to treat information in the library with the same high standards of care that they treat information collected in their own laboratories.### How long will information remain in the library?Information in the library will be preserved indefinitely in a secure location. We do not intend to delete the information.
