## 1.	What is Databrary?

Databrary (http://databrary.org) is a library for research data and software tools. It is an ecosystem for sharing behavioral and neural science data and the tools to analyze these data among a community of researchers. The Databrary aims to facilitate data sharing and greater transparency within labs, among collaborators, with other researchers and members of the larger developmental science community, and with the general public.
 
The research data stored in Databrary consists of video, audio, static, or ordered image sequences, physiological or position sensor data, spreadsheets, databases, manuscripts, coding manuals, and other metadata associated with scientific research in the behavioral and neural sciences. The tools stored in Databrary consist of software that aids the extraction, visualization, and analysis of time series based research data. These tools may be open source, freeware, or commercially licensed, and may be supplemented by sample data sets, web links to data sets shared elsewhere within Databrary, or documentation. Every data set and tool will have its own unique, permanent uniform resource locator (URL) - web address - so that researchers may both take credit for their own Databrary contributions and properly and consistently cite the Databrary resources they use from others.
 
The Databrary ecosystem also includes a database of  and contributorsmembers who have permission to use and contribute data. The database keeps track of the identities of each member who contributes to, browses data within, withdraws data or tools from Databrary, and cites Databrary resources.

## 2.	The Challenges of Databrary

Implementing the Databrary ecosystem poses several challenges. The most crucial challenge concerns research ethics. 

Principles of ethical research with human participants require that individuals depicted in any recording that contains identifiable information must give permission for their data to be shared with others in Databrary. Individuals must decide what level of sharing permission they wish to give-no permission at all because they do not wish to share data-or sharing permission with different levels of restriction concerning who can view and analyze the data. Only recordings for which permission to share has been given by all individuals depicted may be shared with Databrary. In turn, Databrary must ensure that the level of access agreed to by individuals who give permission to share is guaranteed. This means that information about sharing permissions must be permanently linked with individual data files in Databrary. It also means that members who access files in Databrary must agree to follow the wishes of individuals who grant permission for their data to be shared.
 
Any intentional identification of a research participant or unauthorized disclosure of his or her confidential information violates the _promise of confidentiality_ given to the research participant. This requirement poses a challenge. Many of the data sources, especially video, photographic, and audio recordings contain personally identifying information about research participants and other individuals involved in a study. Images and/or voices may be visible or heard. Names may be spoken out loud. Images and voices of visitors or other people who are not research participants may be recorded. If a study takes place in a home or other setting, aspects of that home or setting may be recorded. Thus, individuals or locations could be identified from recordings.

Therefore, Databrary must do everything possible to ensure that data sets are used solely for research purposes and not for investigation of specific research participants. Databrary and its users must do everything practicable to minimize the chances that individuals can be identified from information shared within Databrary. Databrary staff, data contributors and users must understand, certify competence in, and abide by the highest standards of ethics concerning research with human participants. No data files can be deposited, stored, or shared within the Databrary ecosystem that contain personally identifying information (names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, social media user IDs, personal or professional websites, Social Security or other identification numbers) beyond that incidentally contained in the video or audio recordings-faces, voices, and the physical location of the recording. Additional provisions are described in the sections that follow.

A second challenge concerns the long-term storage of data. Many IRBs require investigators to destroy data after a fixed period of time. However, a central aim of the Databrary is to preserve data in perpetuity. Thus, for Databrary to work, those practices will need to be changed.

## 3.	How Databrary Will Work

This section describes in detail how Databrary will work, from data collection to analysis by other researchers not part of the original study in which data were collected.

### 3.1	Accessing data sets or tools from Databrary

The goal of the Databrary project is to maximize open data sharing. Some data sets (e.g., anonymized, flat-file) may be easily shared with minimal restriction. Sharing other data sets (e.g., video or audio) pose the risk of violating participant confidentiality and must be shared only among researchers who understand, embrace, and formally agree to abide by principles of research ethics that include maintaining participant confidentiality. Thus, Databrary must monitor and control who has access to data sets or tools and what level of access may be granted.

#### Level of access permitted to data or software

We envision four levels of access: unrestricted and open to the public; restricted to authorized Databrary users, but open among those users; restricted by contributor to particular authorized Databrary users; and restricted to the individuals on the contributor's IRB-approved protocol (see Figure 1). The Databrary system will have a set of public pages that allow unrestricted access to video previews of selected data sets and links to data analysis/software tools. We anticipate that some video excerpts that have been granted public access and archival material (e.g., Gesell movies) or material of a purely educational nature (e.g., displays shown to participants) for which no permission to share data is required will have *unrestricted/public* access. The next level of access will be restricted to authorized Databrary users, but open among those users. We anticipate that most data sets that include audio or video recordings, coded spreadsheets linked to video or audio data, and similar metadata will be assigned to the *restricted, but open* access level. The third level of access is *restricted by contributor*. In this level, individual contributors may choose with whom among the Databrary users they wish to share. The same requirements to secure permission to share data apply to data sets that are restricted by contributor. Individual data contributors would manage who has access to their data. Databrary would still announce the availability of new data sets, updates to these data sets, and the user IDs of individuals who are granted access by the contributor to the data. This type of access is similar to that provided by the Dataverse (http://thedata.org/) software environment. The last level of access is *restricted to the contributor's IRB-approved research group*. The only difference between this level and the contributor-restricted level is that the contributor need not obtain participants' permission to share.

![Figure 1: Levels of Access](levels-of-access.png)

#### Types of Access, User Accounts and Privileges

There are three types of access to Databrary's assets: *browsing*, *downloading*, and *contributing*. Individuals who wish only to browse Databrary's public/unrestricted assets may do so without registering with Databrary, however the system will log access by internet protocol (IP) addresses (see Access Logging). Unregistered individuals may not comment in Databrary's comment sections. Individuals who wish to browse Databrary's restricted, but open assets must apply for a member account.

##### Who May Apply for a Member Account

Members must have active Principal Investigator (PI) status at their home institutions. Graduate and undergraduate students, postdoctoral researchers, research scientists, and research staff may be granted *sponsored member* status if they are carrying out research under the supervision of a member. Members who supervise sponsored members must (i) grant permission to researchers under their supervision to view data on their behalf, and (ii) agree to take responsibility for the data use of the sponsored members under their supervision and for the security of the data (where data are stored, etc).

##### Timing of Member Account Application for Researchers Who Want to Share Data

A researcher may apply for member status before formal permission has been granted by an IRB for sharing a given data set, but no contributions can be shared by Databrary until researchers demonstrate that they (1) have permission to share a given data set from an IRB, or (2) have demonstrated that no IRB permission is needed.

##### Application Process

Application for authorized contributor status may be made via a web form. The following information will be sought:

Required
* Name, title, institution, surface address, email, phone.
* Research ethics with human participants training certification (e.g., Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative, CITI; https://www.citiprogram.org), and expiration date of current authorization.
* Information about IRB (or equivalent) that governs the applicant's scientific activity, if applicable, including name(s) of supervising official(s), surface address, telephone number, email.
* Certification of PI status (possibly from the appropriate research ethics entity)
* Institutional agreement [DISCUSS WITH MARK et al]
* An electronically signed copy of the Databrary Membership Agreement

Required for researchers seeking sponsored member status
* Certification of PI status (possibly from the appropriate research ethics entity)
* Institutional agreement [DISCUSS WITH MARK et al]
* Information about the research supervisor: Name, Databrary user ID, name, and email.

Optional, but recommended
* Applicant web site, Research Gate (http://www.researchgate.net) profile, Twitter account, ERA Commons ID.

The application process also requires the assignment of a unique Databrary user ID and password. For transparency and data archiving purposes, Databrary requires that user account IDs be created that concatenate the user's surname, first, and other names or initials, e.g., (gilmore.rick.o or adolph.karen.e) and include an additional numeric suffix assigned by Databrary to disambiguate duplications (e.g., smith.edward.g.1001).

#### Application Review

Once a member or sponsored member application has been completed and submitted, applicants, and their research ethics entity official(s), will receive an automated email confirmation that an application has been received and is under review. Databrary staff will review applications to determine the following:

* Applicant identity information is valid and correct.
* Applicant has human participants ethics clearance from CITI, a local governing IRB or its equivalent.
* Applicant has PI status or equivalent at their institution
* Applicant's institution has agreed to allow contributors and users from the institution 
* Applicant has not violated Databrary use standards in the past.

For individuals seeking sponsored user status, the supervising member will be notified via email that an application has been filed. The supervising member will log on to Databrary, approve (or not) the sponsored member status application, and provide information about the level of access to be provided to this individual - browsing only, or browsing + downloading, or browsing + downloading + uploading.

The member review and approval process will be carried out by project staff under the supervision of the Project Director (Adolph) and Associate Director (Gilmore). The approval and review process will be audited periodically (twice annually) by the Databrary Ethics Committee. 

If the proposal requires revisions, the project staff will communicate the nature of those revisions via email. Once the user application is approved, users and the official(s) from the supervising research ethics entity will be notified by email. The welcome/notification email will include reminders about Databrary policies regarding data use and citation.

#### Access Logging/Usage Metrics

Databrary will log access to the system by user ID and by IP address. Most access logging information will be used by Databrary for internal security, user metrics, and management functions. Some information about files browsed, downloaded, shared, or modified will be announced via the Databrary Twitter, RSS, and other web/social media feeds. For example, Databrary may identify and publicize which data sets are most often browsed, downloaded, and cited.

#### Viewing Data

Any member of the public may browse data sets or tools with unrestricted/public level of access. Individuals with Databrary member status may browse or download data sets and tools with the *unrestricted/public* level of access. Members may also browse or download assets with *restricted, but open* access. They may request access to *restricted by contributor* assets, and if granted access, browse or download those files. All browsing and downloading will be logged by Databrary. Databrary will send periodic reminders to members of downloaded data reminding them to cite datasets and associated papers, to obtain appropriate IRB approvals for conducting research, to maintain the security of the downloaded data, and to remove data that are no longer needed. .

Many possible use cases will involve browsing or downloading data without conducting research on those data (e.g., finding excerpts for teaching, searching for exemplars to facilitate study design, pre-research activities on a dataset to determine whether formal analyses are feasible or promising). If members intend to conduct research with datasets, they may be required to obtain permission from a research ethics entity at their institution; decisions about whether members may conduct research on datasets is beyond Databrary's control. Thus, when permitted by the research entity that supervises their research, members may conduct research on data sets. 

#### Member Account Renewal

Member and sponsored member accounts must be renewed annually. Databrary will send members and sponsored members reminders that their accounts are due to expire and ask researchers to update their account information. To renew their accounts, members and sponsored members will electronically sign the Databrary User Agreement. Information about account renewals will be sent to research ethics staff at each member's home institution.All browsing and downloading will be logged by user.

### 3.2.	Deposits

Researchers or clinicians who wish to deposit data in Databrary must do some planning in advance. They must
 
* Determine the source(s) of the data to be deposited;
* Determine whether individual(s) depicted in the data sets must give permission to share the data; in most cases, the answer is yes.
* Seek and be granted, as appropriate, permission to collect and share data from the research ethics entity (e.g., institutional review board, IRB) that governs research at the researcher or clinician's home institution;
* Collect data and secure permission to share from individuals depicted in the data;
* Apply for and be granted member status with Databrary;
* Prepare data for sharing with Databrary, including tagging files with the level of permission granted by individual(s) depicted in the recordings.
* Seek and be granted, as appropriate, institutional level agreement
* Collect data and secure permission to share from individuals depicted in the data;
* Sources of data

There are two main sources of data: (1) data collected by researchers or clinicians in laboratory or clinical contexts, and (2) data collected from incidental sources not intended for research or clinical purposes. The latter may include home movies or videos, recordings from security cameras or microphones, cameras or other recordings made in public places, and recordings shared with the public via web portals such as YouTube (http://www.youtube.com) or Vimeo (http://vimeo.com). Laws governing whether recordings made in public places may be used for research purposes may vary. Researchers who wish to deposit data from these or other non-laboratory/non-clinical setting sources should consult with their local IRBs.

There are two primary types of studies involving video data or other data streams: (1) new video data sets with associated metadata (coding spreadsheets, analyses, manuscripts, etc.); and (2) reused video data sets (complete data sets, subsets of the video files, or video files culled from different original video data sets) with new associated metadata (e.g., new codes). The same PI or research team may reuse the original data. Versioning does not change the status of study types. Versions and reused datasets will retain links with the original and subsequent studies.

#### Seeking IRB Permission To Share Data

Researchers who wish to share data with Databrary should seek permission to do so from their governing research ethics entity. Individuals whose scientific activities are not governed by an IRB may choose to have their protocol reviewed by another entity with similar authority. In preparing applications to the IRB, researchers are strongly encouraged to refer to the document(s) provided by Databrary. These include the following:

* Databrary Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
* [Databrary Data Sharing Permission](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nwt58LWU6Wjsim2J0VaDqtLfGnVz6eR3TS_pmXiKP2E/edit)
* [Databrary Institutional Agreement](https://docs.google.com/a/nyu.edu/document/d/1xuiwztk1wzWFdafDk8Ev7p1O_VG2qe6YpKqp0zGQqXw/edit)
* Databrary Member Agreement

Links to all of the relevant Databrary documents concerning permissions and access may be found on the Databrary website (http://databrary.org/permissions).

#### StatusApplying for Approval to Share Data from a Specific Study

In addition to securing members status, researchers must file a separate web-based application to share data from a specific study or source. That application seeks information commonly included in an application to an IRB for approval to conduct a study. In particular, the following information will be required:

* Name(s), address(es), phone number(s), affiliation(s), email address(es), and Databrary ID(s) of all principal or co-investigators on a project;
* Agreement from all data owners to share and verification of Databrary member status for all Study PIs/data owners.,
* Study name, target population, and thematic tags;
* IRB protocol identifier or number;

What to do when reusing already shared data in Databrary.
* an electronically signed copy of the Databrary Contributor Agreement.

#### Study-level Application Review
Once study-level applications have been completed and submitted, applicants, and their research ethics entity official(s), will receive an automated email confirmation that an application has been received and is under review. Databrary staff will review applications to determine that th proposed data to be deposited does not violate Databrary standards.

The application review and approval process will be carried out by project staff under the supervision of the Project Director (Adolph) and Associate Director (Gilmore). The approval and review process will be audited periodically (twice annually) by the Databrary Ethics Committee. 

If the proposal requires revisions, the project staff will communicate the nature of those revisions via email. Individuals whose applications are rejected by Databrary project staff may appeal the decision to the Databrary Ethics Committee. The decision of the Databrary Ethics Committee is final.

#### Data Set Contribution Approval

Once Databrary staff have confirmed that an application to deposit data meets Databrary standards, the data owner(s) and the research ethics entity official(s) will be notified by email. That email will include information about how and where the data may be uploaded to Databrary. Each data set or tool contribution will be assigned a unique and permanent uniform resource locator (URL), such as 

	databrary.org/gilmore.rick.o.1001/data/2012/study01

or

	databrary.org/gilmore.rick.o.1001/tools/2012/tool01

At this point, the data owner(s) may begin data collection, or if the data have already been collected or the tool readied for sharing, may proceed to upload the data or tool.

#### Member Account Renewal

Contributor status must be renewed annually. Databrary will send members reminders that their accounts are due to expire and ask contributors to update their account information. To renew their member accounts, researchers will electronically sign the Databrary Member Agreement. At the annual renewal, Databrary will also send members information about how their data sets have been accessed.

### 3.3	Securing permission from participants to share data

The principles of informed consent and participant confidentiality are the foundation of ethical research involving human participants. Under most circumstances, the collection of video or audio data requires that individual participants, and for minors their parents or legal guardians, give written informed consent to participate in some specific research activity. Databrary will require that members demonstrate that they have secured explicit written permission to share data with Databrary from each individual depicted in a recording or that the governing IRB has waived the requirement for explicit written permission.

#### How will permission to share data be secured?

Databrary will publish "Permission to Share Data" templates that members should use. An example can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nwt58LWU6Wjsim2J0VaDqtLfGnVz6eR3TS_pmXiKP2E/edit). These templates may be submitted with research ethics entity applications, and should be used by members when they seek permission from research participants.

#### What kinds of permissions to share data may be granted

Research participants (or their parent or legal guardians) or other individuals depicted in a recording may grant different levels of permission to share data:

##### No sharing (Level 0)

No non-anonymized research data from individual participants may be shared beyond the research team on the IRB approved protocol. Anonymized participant data (coding spreadsheets, survey data, physiological data) and aggregate results and statistical analyses may be shared with authorized Databrary members.

##### Sharing, but only within Databrary members' labs (Level 1)

Data may be shared but only with Databrary members who agree to conduct scientific activities in the context of a private, laboratory environment. Video or audio files may NOT be excerpted or presented in public settings-in classrooms, at scientific or technical meetings - nor may digital files be released on the internet, to publishers of textbooks, to the media, or as supplemental material for publications. .

##### Sharing, public excerpts may be shown but not distributed (Level 2)

Research data may be shared with other Databrary members. Video or audio files may be excerpted and presented in public settings-in classrooms, at scientific or technical meetings. Digital files may NOT be released on the internet, to publishers of textbooks, to the media, or as supplemental material for publications..

##### Sharing, public excerpts may be shown and distributed (Level 3)

Research data from individual participants may be shared with other Databrary members. Excerpts from audio or video files selected by a Databrary member may be presented in public settings-in classrooms, at scientific or technical meetings. Digital files MAY be released on the internet, to publishers of textbooks, to the media, or as supplemental material for publications, as long as no identifying information about the depicted participant is included with the excerpt. 

##### What constitutes an excerpt?

An excerpt is a selection from a larger data recording that illustrates a particular point or demonstrates a finding. It is typically no more than a few seconds or minutes in length. Members may select segments of a recording as an excerpt for display in public settings if the individual(s) depicted have granted sharing permission at level 3 or 4. Members must exercise professional judgment about which individuals and which segments are suitable for public viewing and should refrain from creating excerpts for all individuals in a data set.

#### When should permission to share data be sought?

Permission to share data should be sought _after_ a testing session is complete. This creates a clear separation between the consent an individual (or parent or legal guardian) gives to participate in research and the permission to share data. It also ensures that individuals can give informed consent about what sorts of behaviors were recorded during a testing session, and thus, what will be shared. Separating the consent to participate from the permission to share may also reduce the likelihood that participant in-take procedures are unduly prolonged by the additional procedures involved in sharing data. No member should coerce participants or others depicted in a recording to grant permission to share.

#### How will the levels of permission granted by participants be linked to data files?

Member who collect identifiable data will be responsible for ensuring that every participant or individual depicted on a recording gives consent to share data with Databrary.  Consent to share may be secured in writing on paper forms or by electronic signature, but individuals depicted in a recording must be given paper records if electronic signatures are given. Paper copies of the signed consent to share data form must be kept in secured files comparable to those used for storing informed consent forms. If no consent to share data is secured or written documentation of a participant's preference is lost or damaged, then it must be assumed that the data in question may not be shared (Level 0).

There are two ways the level of sharing permission granted by an individual depicted in a recording may be associated with that individual's data files.

##### Manual linking of permission to share levels with individual data files

Members will keep electronic records, in tab or comma-delimited text files, spreadsheets, or comparable formats that provide information about the participant and the level of sharing permission granted. For example, such a file might have the following format:

	participant_id		test_date		mos_at_test	sex		perm_level
	study01_7824		20121230		4.25		m		0
	study01_7825		20121231		4.75		f		2
	study01_7826		20130102		5.15		f		1

In some cases, multiple individuals may be depicted on a recording, some who are research participants, and some who are not. In this case, the permission file may look as follows:

	participant_id		test_date	mos_at_test	sex		perm_level
	study01_7824		20121230	5.15		f		2
	study01_7824_01	20121230	NA		NA		3
	study01_7824_02	20121230	NA		NA		3
	study01_7825		20130102	4.75		m		3	
	study01_7825_01	20130102	NA		NA		0

In this case, the recording featuring participant 7824 includes two other individuals (7825\_01, and 7824\_02) both of whom who gave level 3 permission. But, the participant's parent or guardian gave only level 2 permission, so that level will be binding on the entire recording. Similarly, for the recording featuring participant 7825, level 3 permission was given, but a non-participant refused to grant sharing permission. Thus, no recording depicting this individual may be shared. If the recording can be edited to remove this person from the recording, the modified file may be shared.

Note that these files must not contain personally identifying information. Participants must be identified by alphanumeric code. Databrary will recommend best practices about the construction of participant identification codes in order to facilitate automated deposit cataloging. Contributors who use the LabNanny software will have Databrary-compatible participant identification codes assigned for them. Investigators are strongly encouraged to provide participant's age-at-testing and sex.

Databrary will publish text (.txt, .csv) and spreadsheet (.xls, .xlsx, .odf) templates to make it easy for investigators to report this type of information in a consistent format. Before any raw data files may be uploaded to Databrary, participants must upload information about participant sharing permission levels in one of these approved formats.

##### Automatic tagging of individual data files with permission to share level

Some members may choose to use Databrary's LabNanny data management environment. Under this scenario, LabNanny would be used by the investigator to collect meta-data about participants and their sharing preferences at the time of each lab visit. That meta-data would be entered into the LabNanny system during or shortly after a visit, and the LabNanny system would contain a centralized, electronic version of the manual file described previously. 

Then, when an investigator decides it is time to share a given data set, the sharing permission levels and related individual-level metadata identified at the time of data collection will be transferred to Databrary via the LabNanny software.

#### How will levels of permission to share be maintained within the Databrary system once files have been uploaded?

Databrary will maintain a database for each study, and each study will include individual-level records for each data set for which sharing permission has been granted. If either the manual permission to share document indicates a sharing level of 0-no sharing-the file(s) associated with that individual will not be uploaded to Databrary. Summary statistics will be kept for each study indicating the number, age, and sex of individuals whose data was not shared with Databrary. This is necessary in order to allow meta-analyses and subsequent data set users to determine what proportion of the shared or published data was actually shared. For sharing levels 1, 2, and 3 members will upload video and audio files and for levels 2 and 3, contributors may create short excerpts that users can use in public settings but users are also free to create their own excerpts for use in public settings. 

Files denoting the individual-level sharing levels will accompany each Databrary data set retrieval. Members who retrieve data sets will commit to upholding the sharing permissions granted by the original participants. This commitment will be part of the Member Agreement each investigator must sign. In addition, Databrary will track which users browse and retrieve which data sets. 

A future version of the Datavyu coding tool will use the permission to share file to provide reminder alerts/warnings to investigators about the level of access permitted for a given data set. But, for the time being, investigators will have to monitor the use of recorded data manually.

### 3.4	Sharing with Databrary

Before a data set may be shared with Databrary, investigators must evaluate video/audio and associated individual-level meta-data for volatile or sensitive content. Even if a participant (or parent or legal guardian) has given permission to share data, the ultimate responsibility for determining whether data should be shared lies with the investigator. If an investigator determines that an individual's data set should not be shared, the investigator will code the sharing level as -1 either in the sharing permission file or within the LabNanny system. Note, the -1 tag differentiates investigator choice not to share from participant initiated refusal to permit sharing.

#### Contributors provide study-level meta-data

Databrary's database includes investigator-level, study-level, participant-level, and measure-level meta-data. Members provide investigator-level meta-data at the time they apply for member status and preliminary study-level meta-data at the time they apply to deposit a specific data set. Prior to or during the process of uploading participant-level data to Databrary, contributors may provide enhanced study-level meta-data. This may include manuscripts, posters or talks, figures, statistical analysis scripts, code books, or grant proposals. The default will be for study-level meta-data to have level 3 sharing permission associated with it.

#### Contributors upload/deposit data to Databrary

Members may either upload data to Databrary manually, using the Databrary site's upload tool or use the automated file transfer system embedded within LabNanny. Members must log-on to the Databrary system in either case. With manual deposit, members must select the study for which data are being uploaded, the participant permission file, and the individual files that will be uploaded.

LabNanny users or users of other lab management software compatible with the Databrary API will simply indicate that a data set is ready to share. The LabNanny or other software will manage the upload/transfer process. 

#### Databrary translates video and meta data into common format(s)

Once data sets have been uploaded to Databrary, they will be automatically converted into a standard set of formats. The specific formats will be determined based on an assessment of how best to preserve the data for the long term using open (non-proprietary) formats, but UTF-8 and H264 video formats are leading candidates for text and video files, respectively. Databrary will publish information about the data formats accepted for deposits and those used and supported within the data sharing system.

#### Databrary checks data

Once the file conversion process has completed, a set of automated and manual data quality checks will commence. The automated checks will assess whether sharing permission levels have been provided for every individual participant in the uploaded data set and whether personally identifying information (addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, telephone numbers) have been provided in the uploaded data. Manual data quality checks will assess transcoding quality-whether video/audio is readable-and consist of spot checks about whether the uploaded data are consistent with Databrary ethical standards. If the quality of the transcoded recordings is poor, they will be checked against the uploaded original files. If the original files are in good condition, they will be transcoded again. If the original files are in poor condition, the contributor will be asked to upload the files again. 

Once Databrary has certified that an uploaded data set is ready to share, the contributor will receive an email indicating that fact. Contributors may then review the data set. When contributors are ready to share the data set, they will log on to Databrary and share the data set.

#### Databrary publishes data with permanent URL

When a new data set is released for sharing, Databrary will announce the event on its website with the data set's description, author(s), and URL. Databrary will also announce new data sets on Twitter, Google+, Facebook, and other social media, as appropriate. Members may choose to subscribe to a data set or another member's news feed to receive updates about new contributions or revisions to old ones.

Members may choose to share partial data sets and update or modify them as new data becomes available or new analyses are conducted. Databrary will maintain a versioning system similar to that used by Github (http://github.org) to maintain records about data provenance. Significant modifications or additions to existing data sets will also be published via the web, email, and social media.

### 3.5	Ensuring Ethical Practices, Handling Violations

#### Databrary Ethics Standards

Databrary intends to uphold the highest standards of integrity. These standards include the following:

* every Databrary staff member and member will complete training in research ethics involving human participants from an official research ethics training entity and keep current their human participants training certification with such an entity.
* every Databrary staff member and member is expected to embrace and enact the principle of informed consent. This means that individuals who are recorded on video, audio or other means have the right to determine whether their data may be shared, and if shared, with whom. 
* Investigators must accurately record the data sharing permission preferences expressed by users. 
* Members must transfer information about individuals' data sharing preferences accurately to Databrary. 
* Databrary must label data files accurately. 
* Members who browse or download data must respect the sharing preferences expressed by participants.
* Databrary staff and members are expected to embrace and enact the principle of participant confidentiality. This means that individuals who are recorded on video, audio or other means have the right to have their identities kept confidential.
* Contributors must not upload or share files that contain personally identifying information.

#### Databrary Ethics Committee

Databrary will form an Ethics Committee to monitor the project, review and modify ethics policies, and to adjudicate ethics complaints. The Ethics Committee will consist of five members of Databrary's Advisory Board, staff representatives from the NYU and PSU compliance offices, three members of the community of members, and the Databrary Staff. The committee will meet via conference call or webinar every other month.
