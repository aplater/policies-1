# Introducing Databrary (<http://databrary.org>)
## A Guide for Institutions

Terms in *italics* are defined at [http://databrary.org/user-guide/policies/definitions.html](http://databrary.org/user-guide/policies/definitions.html)

### 1.	What is Databrary?

Databrary is a data library intended to foster sharing of information among researchers. Databrary contains *De-Identified Data, Non-Identifiable Data*, and *Metadata*. Databrary also contains *Identifiable Data* – video/audio recordings and photographic images Databrary calls *Recordings* – and other sensitive materials, such as *Self-Reported Health-Related Information*, only some of which are open to the public. *Data* in the library might be used to determine the identity of research participants who have been promised confidentiality. *Data* might also be used to harm or embarrass *Research Participants* or other *Depicted Individuals*. Accordingly, Databrary requires prior authorization for full access and requires those granted access to uphold the highest ethical standards. Individuals with authorized access to Databrary are called *Investigators*.

Databrary is supported by awards from the U.S. National Science Foundation and Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.

### Who can access Databrary?

Access to most of Databrary's resources is restricted to people who have prior authorization. To receive authorization a person must apply to Databrary and receive approval. 

#### Who qualifies for access?

*Principal Investigators (PI)* at an *Institution* may qualify. Researchers whose work is overseen by someone who is a *Databrary Principal Investigator*, may qualify to be an *Affiliate Investigator*. Databrary may also authorize a person based on a track record of scientific accomplishment or on the basis of a written reference from someone who is an authorized *Databrary Principal Investigator*. The *Databrary Principal Investigator* must verify that the applicant's use of *Data* from the library will be strictly for the purpose of legitimate scientific research. 

All applicants must demonstrate that they have passed a human participants ethics training class and remain in good standing with the *Institution* that supervises ethics training.

### How does Databrary grant authorization?

#### Information about the Applicant

Applicants must provide Databrary information about their professional appointment status at an *Institution* along with contact and other information that verifies the applicant's identity. There is no anonymous access to protected Databrary resources. Some affiliate applicants may be asked to provide evidence about their record of scientific accomplishment. 

#### Investigator Agreement

Applicants must sign and date the Databrary Investigator Agreement (<http://databrary.org/user-guide/policies/investigator-agreement.html>). Applicants for affiliate status must provide the name of the *Databrary Principal Investigator* who will oversees the affiliate's research or who will write a letter of recommendation. 

The application should be signed and dated by an Authorizing Official at the applicant's *Institution*. Once the application is returned to Databrary, staff will make a final determination about an applicant's status and either grant or deny access.

### How is Databrary different from other data archives or repositories?

#### The Databrary Investigator Agreement combines data use and data contribution

Many data repositories require that data use agreements be signed prior to access. Most data repositories have a separate agreement associated with data contribution. Databrary has combined these into one agreement. Most behavioral scientists do not currently share data. Databrary seeks to reduce barriers to data sharing to make it the norm, not the exception. Combining data use and contribution into one agreement reduces procedural or administrative barriers to data sharing. This is in keeping with Federal mandates to share research data and emerging practices related to openness in scientific research.

#### Video enables use cases that extend beyond research

Unlike many forms of flat-file, text-based *Data*, video is to a large degree self-documenting. As a result, we anticipate that most Databrary *Investigators* and *Affiliates* will use Databrary for a variety of pre-research or non-research uses, including viewing videos for methodological details or to find excerpts for teaching or scientific presentations.

In signing the agreement, all *Investigators* promise to seek IRB approval whenever their use of Databrary requires it. But, prior IRB approval need not be required to enter or view Databrary's resources for non-research purposes.

#### Databrary contains *Identifiable Data* for which participants have given permission to share

In order to contribute and share *Identifiable Data* with Databrary, *Investigators* must get approval from the people from whom the *Data* were collected. Databrary provides a template release form (<http://databrary.org/user-guide/policies/release-template.html>) and recommends it be included in any IRB protocol. But, a given *Institution* may deem other release language to provide equivalent protections. 

The important point is that people whose identities might be discovered through *Data* shared with Databrary have been asked for their permission to share this information with other researchers. Thus, the people depicted have given informed consent to share their *Data*.

Whether *De-identified Data* may be shared with Databrary without seeking explicit permission depends on the *Investigator's* IRB. Some IRBs allow *De-identified Data* to be shared without explicit permission of the person tested.

*Investigators* promise to provide Databrary information about whether *data* may be shared or not. *Investigators* must also indicate whether *excerpts* from recordings may be shown in educational or scientific settings.

#### Databrary intends to store *Data* indefinitely

Some IRBs encourage researchers to include promises to destroy *Data*, especially recordings, after some fixed time period in order to limit risk to participants. Data destruction is antithetical to data-sharing, and Databrary's Template Release language seeks explicit permission to share data indefinitely. Researchers who wish to store *Data* on Databrary should remove data destruction clauses from their informed consent documents for new *Data* and seek IRB guidance about whether archival *Data* can be shared.

### Who's part of Databrary?

Databrary is a joint project of New York University and The Pennsylvania State University. Other *Institutions* that are currently participating include:

- Rutgers University
