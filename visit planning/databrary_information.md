## Databrary Information Collection

The purpose of this document is to explain to PIs the kinds of information we can collect about sessions and participants, so we can represent data in a way that makes sense to the PIs and is also useful to the Databrary community. We also want to give guidelines on how to report this information to us. This is information they might already collect, or have in their heads, but just not reported in any single document. Unless otherwise noted, if there is no information about these fields, then we will not use those fields in the PIs dataset(s). We do not want PIs to feel overwhelmed by all number of the following fields. They can report the fields that they collect and make the most sense for their own data. If there are additional fields they collect information about and want to add, they can feel free to add those to their data.
