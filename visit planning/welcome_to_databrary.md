# Welcome to Databrary

We are so happy you decided to share your data with the Databrary community. There are a few things we want you to think about while you're putting your data together and deciding what to share. Our wish is to make this process as easy for you as possible. We've determined the best way to do this is by enumerating what we need from you.

We will contact you to discuss your data in detail, but here are a few things you should start thinking about. We know data sharing is new and it can be hard to keep everything organized. We expect that that not everything we ask for is collated, organized or digitized, but we want you to start thinking about the logistics of sharing your data.  

# Organization

Databrary is designed so that the most basic unit of organization is a session. We consider a **session** to be a specific period of time when data are collected from a participant or participants, typically a single visit. Sessions are like folders that contain all the raw data collected during this visit, including videos, survey responses, or other measurements or observations.

We then collect sessions into a **dataset**, which is the collection of video files and other raw data. Datasets typically reflect a set of related procedures or data from a group of participants observed longitudinally. Datasets can be as big or as small as suits your research design. Often a dataset is equivalent to a study. But one dataset can spawn multiple studies. Multiple datasets can be combined into a single study. Datasets include everything you did to collect your raw video data, so if available include a protocol of your procedure and stimuli or displays shown to participants.

Once you have one or more datasets, we can create what we call a **study** to represent a research product. Typically, a study is a published paper, but it could also reflect unpublished data. Often a study and a dataset are the same. But a study can be made up of sessions from multiple datasets, or can be a subset of a dataset. Studies can also include files that provide valuable information—especially links to published papers, coding manuals, and coding spreadsheets. You can also include analyses files, figures, presentations, and other metadata with your study.

Think about your data in terms of **sessions**, **datasets** and **studies**. How would your data fit into this organization structure? 

We’ll ask you to provide names for your datasets. We prefer that you use descriptive names rather than idiosyncratic names. Think of the most important components of your data. It could be something like the tasks or a physical description or a display or technique.

We’ll need you to summarize your dataset in a short paragraph that describes the  participants, procedures, a physical description of the critical activities, and the setting in which in took place. You do not need to describe the motivation or rationale for collecting the data because this information will be attached to your studies in the form of the (un)published abstract.

Besides videos, what other kinds of data would you want to share to enrich your dataset? These could be descriptions of procedures or tasks, coding manuals, stimuli, etc.



# Digitization 

Are your videos already digitized? Please think about where your files are stored. Are they all in one place? Are they on a hard drive or a server or a combination of the two? Would we be able to access your files? How would we access your files? What is the approximate size of all the files you want to share? What format are you files in? We can transcode mostly anything to our standard format, but it's a good thing to know. 

### File names

What do you use for file names? To make the ingest process smoother, we have a few stipulations.

* Use alphanumeric filenames. Letters, numbers, underscores and hyphens are okay.
* Please remove any spaces or punctuation that is not a hyphen or underscore.
* Make sure your file names all have extensions (.mp4, .mov, etc.). 

Please note these rules apply to video files as well as other files (protocols, coding spreadsheets, images, etc)

### What if my videos are not digitized

Maybe you only collect data on tape or you have older videos you want to share. Maybe your digital files are corrupted or lost. Let us know what your needs are and we can help you find a solution.


# Collecting metadata

We know you already collect a lot of information about your data in your lab, but maybe you don't have all that information recorded in the same place. Think about what kind of information you collect and where that information is, and what the process of putting all that information together and sending it to us would be. There are a few pieces of information that we must have from you: **test date**, **birth date** and **what level of sharing the participant consented to**. We do collect any information that you are willing to share with us. Below are a some of the types of information we would like to have. As you read through these, think about if you have that information somewhere and where that information is. Also, think about what other kinds of information you collect that we did not include below. 

### Information about the session
A session refers to a single visit or observation period. Participants may be observed at multiple sessions (e.g., longitudinal studies) and you should provide information for each session. Multiple participants may be observed at a single session (two siblings observed playing together) and you should provide information for each participant.
	
#### Information we must have
* test date
	*YYYY-MM-DD
* release level
	* private - The participant(s) did not consent to share their data
	* shared - The participant(s) consented to share their data with the databrary community
	* excerpts - The participant(s) consented to have their data shared with the databrary community and to having excerpts shown to the public for educational and research purposes
	* public - The participant(s) consented to have their data shared with the world at large
	* no consent information - The default if no consent level information is provided will be private.
	
#### Other information you may already collect 
* exclusion
	* Was this session excluded from the final study? Why? 
* setting
	* In what kind of environment did the session take place?
* country
	* In what country did the session take place?
* state
	* In what state did the session take place
* condition
	* Did the dataset have between-subject conditions that hold for the entire data set? Please use descriptive labels
* group
	* Did the dataset have between-subject groups that hold for the entire dataset? Please use descriptive labels
	
### Information about the participant
A participant refers to a single person contributing data to a single dataset. Participants can be in multiple sessions (longitudinal datasets). But if the participant is in a different dataset, then he/she should be identified with a new participant id associated with that 
dataset.
