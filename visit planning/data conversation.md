#Data Conversations
### These conversations are a template, not a script

### All conversations should be recorded


### The most important information we need:

* What information a PI collects for their participants (birthday,test date, age), and what other information they collect that's important for them  (language, location, race, ethnicity, etc) and where they keep that information
* If a PI has pilot/attrition/excluded participants, how they want those grouped/notated, the reasons for exclusion and if they want those included with the rest of their data
* What other ways the PI groups their data
* What data the PI wants to share besides videos
* What level of permission their forms warrant
* Who to contact: the PI or someone in their lab 

##Step One: Permissible Data

### This is an earlier conversation Lisa will have with the PI

* Open a conversation about already permissioned data. If the PI answers something like: I’d like to share everything I can share. What can I share on databrary, then Lisa can look at the forms.* Action items for PIs: Where are their IRB protocols? Can past release forms be okayed by the IRB? 
**What level of access do these forms warrant?** 
**How is the permission level information stored and what is the best way for us to compile that information?**##Step Two: Gathering information about the data
#### *Get an overview of how the PI's data is organized* **Show me where and how you organize your videos and your other files? Briefly explain how your data is organized and how you describe the different kinds of files (ex: coding/coding manuals/protocols/list of subjects).**
#### *Explain how Databrary is organized by the session level, and talk to the PI about how they group their data*
**Databrary has been designed so that the most basic unit that we organize by is a session. We consider a session to be a specific period of time when a participant or participants are being observed.  Knowing that, if you had to sit down and enter data yourself for a few days, how would you organize your data?**
**What is a session to you?**
**What is a dataset to you?**
**What is a study to you?**
**How many (participants/households/etc) are included in your dataset?**
**Do you have pilot participants? Would you want those shared on databrary as pilots?**
**Do you exclude any participants? Why? Would you want these shared on databrary as excluded?**
**What ways, if any, do you have of grouping participants/sessions? Ex: tasks, locations, age group, etc**
**Do you have any multi-visit or longitudinal studies where you keep track of the same participants?**

**Do you have videos with multiple participants**

**Do you have videos with multiple tasks/tests?**

**Do you collect data in different locations? What locations?**

#### *Find out what information the PI collects about the participants and the sessions, where they keep that information, and what information is important for them* 

**Do you have birth date, test date and gender information for each participant? Is there other data you collect about participants that is specific and useful for understanding your data? Other PIs have provided ethnicity, race, language etc**


**Where do you keep that participant information? Is it compiled in one file/location or across several files/locations?**

**What other information do you collect?**

**What information do you have about your data this is important to you, and to understand your data?**

**Do you have standardized forms of description or metadata?**

**Is this amount of organization and description sufficient for another person with similar expertise to understand and use your data?**

#### *Determine what kinds of files the PI has and what the PI wants to share*

**Once your data is collected, what do you do with it? What do you consider raw data?**

**What format(s) are your videos in and why?**

**What other kinds of files exist and in what formats?**

**What important components of your data do you want to share on databrary? What other files do you want to share that describe your data that would be useful to other researchers? What we really want is the raw data (videos) but any other data are extra and welcome.** 

**Do you have protocols? Could you show me a typical protocol? Is this something you'd be willing to share?**

**What do you use to code? Can you show me a typical coding manual/coding? Is this something you'd be willing to share**	   

**What data from what stages would you be willing to share and with whom?** ***Analysis Material (e.g. coding, syntax files, spss files, etc)***	No one	Immediate collaborators/Institution	Others in my field	Everyone/public***Supplementary Materials (e.g. coding manuals, blank questionnaires, protocols, measures, etc)***	No one	Immediate collaborators/Institution	Others in my field	Everyone/public***Raw Data (e.g. videos, filled-out questionnaires, etc)***	No one	Immediate collaborators/Institution	Others in my field	Everyone/public***Other (please define)***	No one	Immediate collaborators/Institution	Others in my field	Everyone/public
	
**What tools – software or hardware – are used to generate your data? How?** **What tools  -software or hardware- are required to use your data? How? Is this tool needed by others to make use of your data?** 
	
**When would you be willing to share all your data? Immediately?  After the results are published?** #### *Procure extra information about how dataset should look and be represented in Databrary***What keywords would you use to find your own data in Databrary?****Do you have pictures or images you want to add to your data? Or should we pull thumbnails from your videos?** 
**What keywords would you use to find your own data in Databrary?**
**Would you be willing to provide a descriptive title and a two or three sentence description of your dataset(s) that we can post on Databrary? You can think about this and send it later, and we can always change it.**
**What preparations or actions, if any, would need to take place before your data could be shared with Databrary? Ex: reviewing/proofreading the data, scrubbing the data for identifying information**
**What is the next step we need to take to share your data?****Are there any relevant documents or publications that would help me better understand your data?**
**Are there other things about your research you’d like to share? Let’s talk about it. We can expound on your videos, what you scored, your coding manual, etc.**  
#### *Gather information about how the PI manages their data***How do you currently manage your data?** **Do you back up your data? How and how often?** **Do you take any security measures to protect your data?** 
#### *Ask the PI about their thoughts on Databrary***What made you decide to deposit your data into Databrary?** **Are there any services in particular you want databrary to provide?****Do you have any concerns about sharing your data in Databrary?** **When you imagine uploading your data in Databrary, what do you envision the process to be like?**
#### *Set up the ongoing communication process throughout the collection and ingest of data*
**We will be checking in with you as we upload your data into Databrary. What level of involvement do you want with your data organization?** 
**Once we upload data, would you like to upload more docs or organize your data further yourself, or is that something you'd like us to do for you with your guidance?** 
**Do you want to be the contact person for your lab? Or do you want to appoint someone to be your liaison?**
##Step Three: Acquiring Data

* Create a customized spreadsheet for researcher reflecting their data and metadata
* Devise a way to transfer data to our server
* Set up PI with Databrary account and show them how to sign in a view/edit/upload data on their own so they have that option if they want it
* Check in with PI as we upload data at every stage
* After data is uploaded on Databrary, present to PI for approval and make any changes the PI wants
