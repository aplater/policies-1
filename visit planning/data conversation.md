#Data Conversations

We think of this document as set of notes on the curation process, we welcome comments and feedback about the ideas that follow. The intention is for this to lead to a document for contributors that will describe how they can expect the curation process to go.

###The key information we are looking for:

* What information a PI collects for their participants (birthday,test date, age), and what other information they collect that's important for them  (language, location, race, ethnicity, etc) and where they keep that information
* If a PI has pilot/attrition/excluded participants, how they want those grouped/notated, the reasons for exclusion and if they want those included with the rest of their data
* What other ways the PI groups their data
* What data the PI wants to share besides videos
* What level of permission their forms warrant
* Who to contact: the PI or someone in their lab 

##Step Zero: Permissible Data

*For these purposes, we are assuming that Lisa has worked with the contributor to determine what datasets/studies have permissions that allow sharing. These could be data previously collected with language their IRB deemed equivalent with Databrary sharing or data collected with the **Databrary Release.***

### Action items for PIs: 

- Where are their consent forms? 
	- Databrary/Lisa can review and advise.
- Can language on consent or release forms be okayed by their home IRB? 
- What level of access do these forms warrant? 
	- Lisa can help them to compare the sharing levels in Databrary with their consent/release language, **BUT**
	- PI/Contributor must make the determination about what they want to warrant
- How is the permission level information stored and what is the best way for us to compile that information?

##Step Two: Initial conversation with contributor about their data organization

*Our main goal here is to get an idea of what data the contributor collects and how they think about organizing it.* 

We might lead with something like: "[FILL IN HERE… OR CHANGE WHATEVER We know data sharing is new and we know how hard it is to keep everything as organized as we'd like. It's completely ok if everything isn't yet organized. We want to think with you about all the important information you want to pull out of your data and store in Databrary. We can help you all throughout the process.]"

Can you show me where your data is and how you organize your videos and your other files? Can you explain how you describe the different kinds of files (ex: coding/coding manuals/protocols/list of subjects.

####*We can then explain how Databrary is organized by sessions, and talk to the PI about how they group their data.*

Databrary has been designed so that the most basic unit that we organize by is a session. We consider a session to be a specific period of time when a participant or participants are being observed.  Knowing that, if you had to sit down and enter data yourself for a few days, how would you organize your data?

#####Some sample questions:
- *What is a session to you?*

- *What is a dataset to you?*

- *What is a study to you?*

- *How many (participants/households/etc) are included in your dataset?*

- *Do you have pilot participants? Would you want those shared on databrary as pilots?*

- *Do you exclude any participants? Why? Would you want these shared on databrary as excluded?*

- *What ways, if any, do you have of grouping participants/sessions? Ex: tasks, locations, age group, etc*

- *Do you have any multi-visit or longitudinal studies where you keep track of the same participants?*

- *Do you have videos with multiple participants*

- *Do you have videos with multiple tasks/tests?*

- *Do you collect data in different locations? What locations?*

####*Then we want to learn what information the PI collects about the participants and the sessions, where they might already have that information recorded electronically, and what information is important for them* 

*Do you have birth date, test date, and gender collected about each participant? Is there other data you collect about participants that is important for your work or potentially helpful to someone repurposing your data? For example, we've found that other for researchers ethnicity, race, language, or where the data are collected are incredibly important labels for their participants.*

*Where do you currently keep that participant-level information? Is it compiled in one file/location or across several files/locations? Is any of it on paper and has never been entered into a digital format?*

*What other information do you collect?*

*What information do you have about your data this is important to you?*

*Do you have standardized forms of description or metadata?*

[NOT SURE THIS IS A NECESSARY QUESTION (LS) ] *Is this amount of organization and description sufficient for another person with similar expertise to understand and use your data?*

####*Now we would want to learn what kinds of files the PI has and which files the PI might want to share*

*Once your data is collected, what do you do with it? What do you consider raw data?*

*What format(s) are your videos in and why?[WHY ARE WE ASKING WHY? (LS) ]*

*What other kinds of files do you use or produce and in what formats?*

*What important components of your data or analyses do you want to share on databrary? What other files do you want to share that describe your data that would be useful to other researchers?*

[CAN WE SKIP THIS QUESION? (LS) ]*Do you have protocols? Could you show me a typical protocol? Is this something you'd be willing to share?*

*What do you use to score and analyze your video? Can you show me a typical coding manual/coding spreadsheet? Is this something you'd be willing to share?*

*What data from what stages would you be willing to share and with whom?*

#####Here are some examples of other materials that you might have.

######**Analysis Material (e.g. coding, syntax files, spss files, etc)**

	- No one 
	- Immediate collaborators/Institution
	- Others in my field
	- Everyone/public

######**Supplementary Materials (e.g. coding manuals, blank questionnaires, protocols, measures, etc)**

	- No one 
	- Immediate collaborators/Institution
	- Others in my field
	- Everyone/public

######**Raw Data (e.g. videos, filled-out questionnaires, etc)**

	- Everyone/public

######**Other (please define)**

	- No one 
	- Immediate collaborators/Institution
	- Others in my field
	- Everyone/public

*What tools – software or hardware – are used to generate your data? How?* 

*What tools  -software or hardware- are required to use your data? How? Is this tool needed by others to make use of your data?*

*When would you be willing to share all your data? Immediately?  After the results are published?*

#### *Procure extra information about how dataset should look and be represented in Databrary*

*What keywords would you use to find your own data in Databrary?*

*Do you have pictures or images you want to add to your data? Or should we pull thumbnails from your videos?*

*What keywords would you use to find your own data in Databrary?*

*Would you be willing to provide a descriptive title and a two or three sentence description of your dataset(s) that we can post on Databrary? You can think about this and send it later, and we can always change it.*

*What preparations or actions, if any, would need to take place before your data could be shared with Databrary? Ex: reviewing/proofreading the data, scrubbing the data for identifying information*

*What is the next step we need to take to share your data?*

*Are there any relevant documents or publications that would help me better understand your data?*

*Are there other things about your research you’d like to share? Let’s talk about it. We can expound on your videos, what you scored, your coding manual, etc.* 
#### *Gather information about how the PI manages their data*

*How do you currently manage your data?*

*Do you back up your data? How and how often?*

*Do you take any security measures to protect your data?*

#### *Ask the PI about their thoughts on Databrary*

*What made you decide to deposit your data into Databrary?*

*Are there any services in particular you want databrary to provide?*

*Do you have any concerns about sharing your data in Databrary?*

*When you imagine uploading your data in Databrary, what do you envision the process to be like?*

#### *Set up the ongoing communication process throughout the collection and ingest of data*

*We will be checking in with you as we upload your data into Databrary. What level of involvement do you want with your data organization?*

*Once we upload data, would you like to upload more docs or organize your data further yourself, or is that something you'd like us to do for you with your guidance?*

*Do you want to be the contact person for your lab? Or do you want to appoint someone to be your liaison?**
##Step Three: Acquiring Data

- Create a customized spreadsheet (from template) for researcher reflecting their specific data and metadata
- Organize data transfer from their lab to our server
- Set up PI with Databrary account (Authorization) and show them how to sign in and view/edit/upload data on their own so they have that option if they want it
- Check in with PI as we upload data at every stage
- After initial data is uploaded on Databrary, present to PI for approval and make any changes the PI wants
