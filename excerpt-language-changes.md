- CURRENT:
>Responsibilities of Authorized Investigators. Authorized Investigators must adhere to the Databrary Rights and Responsibilities policy. In addition, Authorized Investigators must acknowledge and agree to comply with Databrary's three guiding ethical principles, which are to: Treat Databrary data with the same high standard of care that they treat data collected in their own lab. Ensure that participants' wishes about sharing their data are respected.
Take care in authorizing other people (affiliates and collaborators) and take responsibility for their conduct and use of Databrary data, just as in own lab.
Additionally, Authorized Investigators agree to: Comply with their Institution's policies on the conduct of research. Have completed research ethics training that meets the Institution's standards. Keep your contact information and Institutional affiliation current on Databrary. Not share or disclose their login information with anyone. Cite all Databrary resources used in their scholarly work using Databrary's suggested format. Share data with Databrary only in accordance with permission granted by subjects. Authorized Investigators must have the right to share with Databrary any data they contribute; no other entity or individual should have ownership rights that prevent an Investigator from contributing data to Databrary. Authorized Investigators must obtain the necessary approvals required by their Institution for contributing data.

- PROPOSED:
>~~Researchers agrees to at all times use the highest level of professional judgment and uphold the highest ethical principles in protecting the privacy interests of human subjects depicted in Databrary files, and in determining which excerpts and images will be shared publicly.  Wherever reasonably possible, researchers will restrict the extent of public exposure to such human subjects, either through password-protected media, closed groups, or through selective use of images.~~ <!--- Declined by Databrary. --->
